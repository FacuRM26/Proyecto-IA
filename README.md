## Overview:
Welcome to Melody the Medical Assistant Chatbot , a Python-based intelligent system utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. This project leverages libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and the OpenAI API. The chatbot serves as a medical assistant, aiding users in identifying potential diseases based on symptoms provided by the user. Additionally, the chatbot offers recommendations and suggests whether a visit to a doctor may be necessary. The chatbot interface is web-based and developed using Django.

## Features:
Natural Language Processing: Utilizes natural language processing techniques to understand and interpret user-provided symptoms.
- Disease Prediction: Predicts potential diseases based on symptom descriptions provided by the user.
- Recommendations: Offers recommendations and advice based on predicted diseases and symptom severity.
- Integration with OpenAI API: Incorporates the OpenAI API for enhanced natural language understanding and generation.
- Web-based GUI: Provides a user-friendly web interface built with Django for seamless interaction with the chatbot.
# Usage:
To utilize the Medical Assistant Chatbot, clone this repository and follow the setup instructions provided in the documentation. Once set up, you can launch the Django web application locally to interact with the chatbot. Users can input their symptoms, receive disease predictions, and obtain recommendations directly through the web interface.

# Dataset:
This project utilizes various medical datasets to train and validate the chatbot's disease prediction model. Details on the datasets used and their sources can be found in the documentation.
